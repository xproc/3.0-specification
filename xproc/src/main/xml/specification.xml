<para>This specification describes the syntax and semantics of
<citetitle>XProc 3.0: An XML Pipeline Language</citetitle>, a language for
describing operations to be performed on documents.</para>

<para>An XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be
performed on documents. Pipelines generally accept
documents as input and produce documents as output.
Pipelines are made up of simple steps which
perform atomic operations on documents and constructs such as
conditionals, iterations, and exception handlers which control which
steps are executed.</para>

<title>Introduction</title>

<para>An XML Pipeline specifies a sequence of operations to be
performed on a collection of input documents. Pipelines take documents
(XML, JSON, text, images, etc.)
as their input and produce documents as their output.</para>

<para>A <glossterm>pipeline</glossterm> consists of steps. Like
pipelines, steps take documents as their inputs and
produce documents as their outputs. The inputs of a step
come from the web, from the pipeline document, from the inputs to the
pipeline itself, or from the outputs of other steps in the pipeline.
The outputs from a step are consumed by other steps, are outputs of
the pipeline as a whole, or are discarded.</para>

<para>There are two kinds of steps:
<glossterm baseform="atomic step">atomic steps</glossterm> and
<glossterm baseform="compound step">compound steps</glossterm>.
Atomic steps carry out a single operation and have no substructure as
far as the pipeline is concerned. Compound steps control the execution
of other steps, which they include in the form of one or more
subpipelines.</para>

<para><biblioref linkend="steps30"/>
defines a standard library of steps. Pipeline implementations
<rfc2119>may</rfc2119> support additional types of steps as well.
</para>

    <para>The media type for pipeline documents is <literal>application/xml</literal>. Often,
      pipeline documents are identified by the extension <filename class="extension"
      >.xpl</filename>.</para>
    <para>In this specification the words <rfc2119>must</rfc2119>, <rfc2119>must not</rfc2119>,
        <rfc2119>should</rfc2119>, <rfc2119>should not</rfc2119>, <rfc2119>may</rfc2119> and
        <rfc2119>recommended</rfc2119> are to be interpreted as described in <biblioref
        linkend="rfc2119"/>.</para>

<section xml:id="intro-examples">
<title>Pipeline examples</title>

<para><xref linkend="fig-xival"/> is a graphical representation of a
simple pipeline that performs XInclude processing and validation on a
document.</para>

<figure xml:id="fig-xival">
  <title>A simple, linear XInclude/Validate pipeline</title>
  <mediaobject>
    <alt>A simple, linear XInclude/Validate pipeline</alt>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="graphics/sch-xinclude-validate-pipeline.png"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>This is a pipeline that consists of two atomic steps, XInclude and Validate with XML
  Schema. The pipeline itself has two inputs, “source” (a source document) and “schemas” (a
  sequence of W3C XML Schemas). The XInclude step reads the pipeline input “source” and produces
  a result document. The Validate with XML Schema step reads the pipeline input “schemas” and
  the result of the XInclude step and produces its own result document. The result of the
  validation, “result”, is the result of the pipeline. (For consistency across the step
  vocabulary, the standard input is usually named “source” and the standard output is
  usually named “result”.) </para>
<para>The pipeline document determines how the steps are connected together inside the pipeline,
  that is, how the output of one step becomes the input of another.</para>
<para>The pipeline document for this pipeline is shown in <xref linkend="ex1"/>.</para>

<example xml:id="ex1">
<title>A simple, linear XInclude/Validate pipeline</title>
<programlisting language="xml"
><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/fig1.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
</example>

<para><xref linkend="ex1"/> is very verbose. It makes
all of the connections seen in the figure explicit. In practice,
pipelines do not have to be this verbose. By default, where inputs and
outputs are connected between sequential sibling steps, they do not
have to be made explicit.</para>

<para>The same pipeline, using XProc defaults, is shown in <xref
linkend="ex1-abbr"/>.</para>

<example xml:id="ex1-abbr">
<title>A simple, linear XInclude/Validate pipeline (simplified)</title>
<programlisting language="xml"
><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/fig1-abbr.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
</example>

<para><xref linkend="fig-style-proc"/> is a more complex example: it
performs schema validation with an appropriate schema and then styles
the validated document.</para>

<figure xml:id="fig-style-proc">
  <title>A validate and transform pipeline</title>

    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="graphics/sch-transform.png"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>The heart of this example is the conditional. The “choose” step
evaluates an XPath expression over a test document. Based on the
result of that expression, one or another branch is run. In this
example, each branch consists of a single validate step.</para>

<example xml:id="ex2">
  <title>A validate and transform pipeline</title>
  <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/fig2.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
</example>

<para>This example, like the preceding, relies on XProc defaults for
simplicity. It is always valid to write the fully explicit form if you
prefer. This example also takes advantage of using the <tag class="attribute">href</tag>
attribute directly on <tag>p:with-input</tag> as a shortcut for the
<tag>p:document</tag> connection.</para>

    <para>The result of evaluating a pipeline (or <glossterm>subpipeline</glossterm>) is the result

      otherwise indicated, implementations <rfc2119>must not</rfc2119> assume that steps are

functional (that is, that their outputs depend only on their

<glossterm baseform="option">options</glossterm>) or side-effect

      <para>An atomic step is a step that performs a unit of processing on
        its input, such as validation or transformation, and has no internal

        indivisible.</para>
      <para>There are many <emphasis>types</emphasis> of atomic steps. The
        standard library of atomic steps is described in <biblioref

        of documents through a pipeline, providing familiar programming

contains.</para>

<para>Compound steps either directly contain a single subpipeline or

        <para>The main purpose of step names in a pipeline is to <emphasis>explicitly</emphasis>
          connect to port(s) of another step. This applies to <tag>p:input</tag>,

        <para>The following example uses the step names provided by the <tag class="attribute"

        <para>If the pipeline author does not provide an explicit name using the <tag

          default names are of the form
            “<literal>!1</literal><replaceable>.m</replaceable><replaceable>.n</replaceable>…” where
            “<replaceable>m</replaceable>” is the position (in the sense of counting sibling
          elements) of the step’s highest ancestor element within the pipeline document or
          library which contains it, “<replaceable>n</replaceable>” is the position of the
          next-highest ancestor, and so on, including all of the elements in the pipeline document
          (that were not <glossterm>effectively excluded</glossterm>). For example, consider the
          pipeline in <xref linkend="ex2"/>. The <tag>p:declare-step</tag> step has no name, so it
          gets the default name “<literal>!1</literal>”; the <tag>p:choose</tag> gets the name
            “<literal>!1.1</literal>”; the first <tag>p:when</tag> gets the name
            “<literal>!1.1.1</literal>”; the <tag>p:otherwise</tag> gets the name
            “<literal>!1.1.2</literal>”, etc. If the <tag>p:choose</tag> had a name, it would not
          have received a default name, but it would still have been counted and its first
            <tag>p:when</tag> would still have been “<literal>!1.1.1</literal>”.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Pragmatically, we say that <glossterm>readable ports</glossterm> are identified by
              a step name/port name pair. By manufacturing names for otherwise anonymous steps, we

            pipeline author must name the step. </para>

      </section>
  
      <section xml:id="step-types">
        <title>Step types</title>

        <para>A step can have a <emphasis>type</emphasis>. Step types are specified using the <tag
            class="attribute">type</tag> attribute of the <tag>p:declare-step</tag> element. Step
          types are used as the name of the element by which the step is invoked. <assert
            xml:id="unique-types">A specified step type <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be unique within its
            scope, see <xref linkend="scoping"/>.</assert></para>

        <para>Step types are QNames and <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> be in namespace with a non-null
          namespace URI. Steps in the XProc standard and additional step libraries all have types in
          the XProc namespace: <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/xproc</code>. When providing your own
          steps with a type, which is necessary to use/invoke them in another step, a different
          (non-null) namespace must be used.</para>

        <para>Step types play an important role in the modularization of pipelines. They allow steps
          to be re-used. The following example defines a local step with type
            <code>mysteps:add-timestamp-attribute</code> and subsequently uses this twice somewhere inside
          its main step’s pipeline: </para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/step-types-1.txt"  parse="text"/></programlisting>

        <para>Another way of doing this would be to isolate the
            <code>mysteps:add-timestamp-attribute</code> step as a separate, stand-alone,
          pipeline:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/step-types-2.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>

        <para>Assuming this is stored in a file called <code>add-timestamp-attribute.xpl</code>, you
          can now use the <tag>p:import</tag> element to get it on board:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/step-types-3.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>

        <para>Yet another way of achieving the same result would be to add the
            <code>mysteps:add-timestamp-attribute</code> step to an XProc
            <emphasis>library</emphasis>, using the <tag>p:library</tag> root element:</para>
        <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/step-types-4.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>

document in a manner that is inconsistent with the
<code>content-type</code> property (accepting an XML document on the
source port but producing a text document on the result, for example), the
processor must assure that the <code>content-type</code> property is appropriate.
If a step changes the <code>content-type</code> in this way, it <rfc2119>must</rfc2119> also
remove the <code>serialization</code> property.</para>

<title>Specifying content types</title>

<para>In some contexts (step inputs, and step outputs, for example), 
XProc allows the pipeline author to specify a
list of content types to identify what kinds of documents are allowed.
Each content type in this list must have one of the following
forms:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>A fully qualified type of the form
“<literal><replaceable>type</replaceable>/<replaceable>subtype</replaceable>+<replaceable>ext</replaceable></literal>”
where “<literal>+<replaceable>ext</replaceable></literal>” is optional and any of <replaceable>type</replaceable>,
<replaceable>subtype</replaceable>, and <replaceable>ext</replaceable>
can be specified as “<literal>*</literal>” meaning “any”.
For example:
<literal>text/plain</literal> (only plain text documents),
<literal>text/*</literal> (any “text” content type),
<literal>*/*+xml</literal> (any “+xml” content type),
and <literal>*/*</literal> (any content type).
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A fully qualified type preceded by a minus sign (“-”) indicates that the specified type is forbidden.
For example:
<literal>-image/svg</literal> forbids SVG images,
<literal>-text/*</literal> forbids “text” content types,
and <literal>-text/html</literal> forbids HTML documents.
</para>

<para>For example: a document with the content type “<literal>image/svg</literal>” is acceptable if the content type list expands
to “<literal>image/* application/xml</literal>” but it is not acceptable if the content type list expands
to “<literal>image/* -image/svg</literal>”. (Note that order matters; the document would be considered acceptable
if the content type list expands to “<literal>-image/svg image/*</literal>”.)
</para>

<para>In the particular case of shortcut values, note that “<literal>application/xhtml+xml</literal>” is acceptable if the

output named “<literal>result</literal>”, and the same set of options.
</para>
      <para>Like atomic steps, top level, user-defined pipelines also have declarations.</para>

<para>The

<para>Output ports on compound steps have a dual nature: from the

      <para>It is also not an error to connect a port that is declared to produce a single document

      <para>An output port may have more than one connection: it may be connected to more than one

        <para>It’s common for some of the documents used in processing a pipeline to be read from
          URIs. Sometimes this occurs directly, for example with a <tag>p:document</tag> element.
          Sometimes it occurs indirectly, for example if an implementation allows the URI of a
          pipeline input to be specified on the command line or if an <tag>p:xslt</tag> step
          encounters an <tag>xsl:import</tag> in the stylesheet that it is processing. It’s also
          common for some of the documents produced in processing a pipeline to be written to
          locations which have, or at least could have, a URI. </para>
        <para>The process of dereferencing a URI to retrieve a document is often more interesting

            possibly appeal to <glossterm>implementation-dependent</glossterm> mechanisms such as
            catalog files.</impl></para>
        <para>In XProc, the situation is made even more interesting by the fact that many

   <section xml:id="connecting-the-drp">
<title>Connections and the Default Readable Port</title>

<para>The <glossterm>default readable port</glossterm> is a
convenience for pipeline authors. In the document which
describes a pipeline, steps are sequential
elements and it is very common for the output of one step to form the
natural input to the step described by its immediately following
sibling. Consider the following fragment:</para>

<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<p:add-xml-base/>

<p:add-attribute attribute-name="element-count"
                 attribute-value="{count(/*/*)}"/>]]></programlisting>

<para>The output from the add XML base step is the natural input to the
add-attribute step. The add XML base step is the source for both the document that will
be processed by the add-attribute step and the document that will be used as the
context item for the expression in the
<tag class="attribute">attribute-value</tag> attribute.</para>

<para>The fact that the output of the default readable port is used by the following
step establishes a connection between the add XML base step and the
add-attribute step.</para>

<para>However, unlike an explicit binding which
<emphasis>always</emphasis> forms a connection, the default readable port
<emphasis>only</emphasis> forms a connection if it is used.
If the
processor determines that the default readable port is not used,
then it must forgo the connection and the steps can run in parallel.</para>

<para>Consider the following fragment:</para>

<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<p:add-xml-base/>

<p:add-attribute attribute-name="class"
                 attribute-value="homepage">
  <p:with-input port="source">
    <p:document href="http://example.com/"/>
  </p:with-input>]]></programlisting>

<para>The output of the add XML base step is still the default
readable port, but it isn’t the source for the add-attribute step nor
is the context item used in evaluating the
<tag class="attribute">attribute-value</tag> option (or any other option,
including the default values of unspecified options), so the processor must
omit the connection. This leads to increased parallelism and possibly
improved performance.</para>

<para>However, it can cause unexpected results when steps have
side-effects. Consider this slightly contrived pipeline
fragment:</para>

<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<p:file-touch href="tempdoc.stamp"/>

<p:file-copy href="tempdoc.stamp" target="time.stamp"/>

<p:file-delete href="tempdoc.stamp"/>]]></programlisting>

<para>Each of the file steps has a primary output port and
consequently provides a <glossterm>default readable port</glossterm>
to the following step. Even though the file steps don’t have input
ports, the document on the default readable port is the context item
for evaluating the options on each step.</para>

<para>However, an implementation will observe that none
of the options use the context item (and there are no inputs).
Consequently, there are no connections between these steps and they can be
run in an arbitrary order, or even in parallel. Running delete,
followed by copy, followed by touch would be perfectly correct but
would not have the side-effects expected by the pipeline
author.</para>

<para>There’s a trade-off here between giving implementations the
freedom to execute pipelines more efficiently and not violating user
expectations. In practice, this problem only arises when scheduling
steps that have side effects, steps with side effects are (relatively)
uncommon, and by their nature are impossible for the processor to
schedule with complete confidence.</para>

<para>The pipeline author can make the dependencies explicit in the
pipeline, which will ensure that the processor schedules the steps in
an order that has the desired the side-effects:
</para>

<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<p:file-touch name="touchstamp" href="tempdoc.stamp"/>

<p:file-copy name="copystamp" depends="touchstamp"
             href="tempdoc.stamp" target="time.stamp"/>

<p:file-delete depends="copystamp"
               href="tempdoc.stamp"/>]]></programlisting>

<para>Explicitly marking the dependencies between steps that have side effects
is good practice.</para>

      <title>XPath in XProc</title>

<para>XProc uses XPath 3.1 as an expression language. XPath expressions
are evaluated by the XProc processor in several places: on compound
steps, to compute the default values of options and the values of
variables; on atomic steps, to compute the actual values of options.
</para>

      <para>XPath expressions are also passed to some steps. These expressions are evaluated by the
        implementations of the individual steps.</para>
      <para>This distinction can be seen in the following example:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/xpathcontext.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
      <para>The select expression on the variable “<varname>home</varname>” is evaluated by the
        XProc processor. The value of the variable is “<uri>http://example.com/docs</uri>”.</para>
      <para>The <option>href</option> option of the <tag>p:load</tag> step is evaluated by the XProc
        processor. The actual <literal>href</literal> option received by the step is simply the
        string literal “<uri>http://example.com/docs/document.xml</uri>”. (The select expression on
        the <literal>source</literal> input of the <tag>p:split-sequence</tag> step is also
        evaluated by the XProc processor.) </para>
      <para>The XPath expression “<literal>@role='chapter'</literal>” is passed literally to the
          <literal>test</literal> option on the <tag>p:split-sequence</tag> step. That’s because the
        nature of the <tag>p:split-sequence</tag> is that <emphasis>it evaluates</emphasis> the
        expression. Only some options on some steps expect XPath expressions. </para>

<para>The XProc processor evaluates all of the XPath expressions in
<tag class="attribute" >select</tag> attributes on variables, options,
and inputs, in <tag class="attribute">match</tag> attributes on
<tag>p:viewport</tag>, and in <tag class="attribute">test</tag>

<title>Transform file system paths into URIs and normalize URIs</title>

<para>Most web technologies identify resources with URIs, but XProc
must also operate with resources that are identified with strings
encoded in other ways, for example, file system paths and the names of
resources in archive files.</para>

<para>The <function>p:urify</function> function attempts to
transform file system paths into file URIs (<biblioref
linkend="rfc3986"/>). If a presumptive yet not fully compliant URI is
given as an argument, <function>p:urify</function> attempts to
resolve the string into a URI.</para>

<para>The <function>p:urify</function> function resolves a string into
a URI by employing a series of heuristics. These have been selected so
that <tag>p:urify</tag> will not corrupt any actual, valid URIs and
with the goal that it will return the least surprising result for any
other string. If a pipeline author has more context to determine how
a string should be transformed into a URI, writing the conversion
process “by hand” in the pipeline may achieve better results.</para>

<para>If the single-argument version of the function is used, the
result is the same as calling the two-argument version with
<parameter>basedir</parameter> set to the empty sequence.</para>

<para>The <function>p:urify</function> function behaves normally during static
analysis.</para>

<para>The heuristics that <function>p:urify</function> performs occur
in two stages: first, the input string is analyzed to identify its
features, then these features are used to construct a final URI
string. An additional “fixup” process may be performed on the path
portion of the URI.</para>

<para>To make the operation of the <function>p:urify</function>
function easier to understand, the description that follows is
presented as an algorithm with regular expressions. Implementors
are not required to implement it this way, any implementation that
achieves the correct results can be used.</para>

<para>The function may be implemented as an operation on strings; it
need not try to determine the existence of a file or directory, and it
<rfc2119>should not</rfc2119> follow symbolic links. However, two
pieces of information need to be known from the environment: Whether
the operating system identifies as “Windows” and the value of the file
separator. More precisely, the operating system identifies as Windows
if the <literal>os-name</literal> property as returned by the
<tag>p:os-info</tag> steps starts with the string
“<literal>Windows</literal>”. The file separator is what
<tag>p:os-info</tag> returns as the <literal>file-separator</literal>
property. If either of them are not known, it is assumed that the
operating system is not Windows and the file separator is the forward
slash, “<literal>/</literal>”.</para>

<para>The comparisons and regular expressions that follow are
presented in lower case, but all of the operations performed are case
blind: “file”, “FILE”, “File”, and “FiLe” are all identical.
</para>

<section xml:id="urify-normalize">
<title>Normalize file separators</title>

<para>Before beginning analysis, if the system file separator is not
“/”, then all occurrences of the file separator in filenames
must be replaced by “/”. (If the file separator
<emphasis>is</emphasis> “/”, this section does not apply.)</para>

<para>Replacing file separators with “/” simplifies the
analysis that follows and assures that the resulting URI will be
syntactically correct. However, it must only be done when it
is determined that the <parameter>filepath</parameter> will become
part of a file: URI.</para>

consider the following cases in turn, stopping at the first which
applies:</para>

<para>On a Windows system, if the <parameter>filepath</parameter> matches the

      that are not handled by the XPath conversion rules: conversions
      from strings to QNames or URIs. (Technically, conversions

      derived from <type>xs:string</type>, values to
      <type>xs:QName</type> or <type>xs:anyURI</type> values.) XProc
      defines additional implicit casting rules for the case where an expression is evaluated
      to provide the value of a variable or option. (These are not extensions to the XPath rules in the

        specify. As a convenience for pipeline authors, the values of variables or options declared with the type
        <type>xs:QName</type> are processed specially. The type <type>xs:QName</type> is treated as

      <title>Namespaces on variables and options</title>

      <para>Variable and option values carry with them not only their literal or computed value but also a set of
        namespaces. To see why this is necessary, consider the following step:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/opns-1.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
      <para>The <tag>p:delete</tag> step will delete elements that match the expression “<literal>html:div</literal>”,
        but that expression can only be correctly interpreted if there’s a namespace binding for the prefix
          “<literal>html</literal>” so that binding has to travel with the option.</para>

      <para>The default namespace bindings associated with a variable or option value are computed as follows:</para>
      <orderedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the <tag class="attribute">select</tag> attribute was used to specify the value and it consisted of a
            single <literal>VariableReference</literal> (per <biblioref linkend="xpath31"/>), then the namespace
            bindings from the referenced option or variable are used.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the <tag class="attribute">select</tag> attribute was used to specify the value and it evaluated to a
            node-set, then the in-scope namespaces from the first node in the selected node-set (or, if it’s not an
            element, its parent) are used.</para>
          <para>The expression is evaluated in the appropriate context, See <xref linkend="xpath-context"/>.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Otherwise, the in-scope namespaces from the element providing the value are used. (For options specified
            using <link linkend="option-shortcut">syntactic shortcuts</link>, the step element itself is providing the
            value.)</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>The default namespace is never included in the namespace bindings for a variable or option value.
        Unqualified names are always in no-namespace.</para>
      <para>Unfortunately, in more complex situations, there may be no single variable or option that can reliably be
        expected to have the correct set of namespace bindings. Consider this pipeline:</para>
      <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/opns-2.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>
      <para>It defines an atomic step (“<literal>ex:delete-in-div</literal>”) that deletes elements that occur inside of
        XHTML div elements. It might be used as follows:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/opns-3.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>

      <para>In this case, the <varname>match</varname> option passed to the <tag>p:delete</tag> step needs
          <emphasis>both</emphasis> the namespace binding of “<literal>h</literal>” specified in the
          <tag>ex:delete-in-div</tag> pipeline definition <emphasis>and</emphasis> the namespace binding of
          “<literal>html</literal>” specified in the <varname>divchild</varname> option on the call of that pipeline.
        It’s not sufficient to provide just one of the sets of bindings.</para>

      <para>If pipeline authors cannot arrange for all of the necessary namespace bindings to be in scope, then EQNames
        can be used to remove the dependency on namespace bindings:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml"><xi:include href="../../../build/examples/opns-4.txt" parse="text"/></programlisting>

      <para>In this example, the expression will match “<literal>p</literal>” elements in the XHTML namespace
        irrespective of any bindings that may or may not be in scope.</para>

    <para>Elements in a pipeline document represent the pipeline, the steps it contains, the
      connections between those steps, the steps and connections contained within them, and so on.
      Each step is represented by an element; a combination of elements and attributes specify how
      the inputs and outputs of each step are connected and how options are
      passed. Outside of inline documents (<tag>p:inline</tag> elements explicitly or implicitly),
text nodes that consist entirely of whitespace and XML comments are ignored. XML processing instructions are
also generally ignored. <impl>It is
<glossterm>implementation-defined</glossterm> if any processing instructions are significant
to an implementation.</impl> In an inline document, all markup is treated as if it was a quoted
part of the inline document and no special semantics apply except as noted elsewhere in this
specification.</para>
    <para>Conceptually, we can speak of steps as objects that have inputs and outputs, that are
      connected together and which may contain additional steps. Syntactically, we need a mechanism
      for specifying these relationships.</para>

<para>Deadlock situations can arise if two or more

if two or more elements are contained within a deadlocked network of

<para>Processors may be required to evaluate expressions in an

equations simultaneously. So, while “declare both <code>ex:A</code> and

conformant processors are not required (or allowed) to find it
because neither the order “A then B” nor the order “B then A” is
sufficient to find the solution.

<section xml:id="depends">
<title>Additional dependent connections</title>

<para xml:id="p.depends">The <tag class="attribute">[p:]depends</tag>
attribute can appear on any step invocation <emphasis>except</emphasis>
<tag>p:when</tag>, <tag>p:otherwise</tag>, <tag>p:catch</tag>, and

<para>In most pipelines, the dependencies that arise naturally
from the connections between steps are sufficient. If step “B”
consumes the output of step “A”, then clearly “A” must run before “B”.
However, it is sometimes the case that one step depends on
another in ways that are not apparent in the connections. Consider,
for example, a pipeline that interacts with two different web
services. It may very well be the case that one web service has to run
before the other, even though the latter does not consume any output
from the former.</para>

<para>When <tag class="attribute">[p:]depends</tag> is used, if step
“Y” depends on step “X”, then “X” must run before “Y”.
</para>

<para>The connections specified by the
<tag class="attribute">[p:]depends</tag> attribute apply
<emphasis>in addition to</emphasis> the dependencies that arise
naturally from connections between steps. Taken together with the
input and output connections, the graph must not contain any loops.
</para>

<para>The <tag class="attribute">[p:]depends</tag> attribute is
forbidden from several elements because they are only conditionally evaluated.
The semantics of dependency are ambiguous at best in this case. Moving the dependency
to the parent element resolves this ambiguity.</para>

<para>The value of the <option>[p:]timeout</option> option must be a

<para>When a pipeline needs to process a sequence of documents using a
subpipeline that only processes a single document, the

        ports is the sequence of documents that is the concatenation of the sequence produced by
        each iteration of the loop on the port to which it is connected. If the iteration source for
        a <tag>p:for-each</tag> is an empty sequence, then the subpipeline is never run and an empty

<para>Each specific error is represented by an <tag>c:error</tag>
element:</para>

<e:rng-pattern name="Error"/>

<para>The <tag class="attribute">name</tag> and <tag
class="attribute">type</tag> attributes identify the name and type,
respectively, of the step which failed.</para>

<para>The <tag class="attribute">code</tag> is an EQName which
identifies the error. For steps which have defined error codes, this
is an opportunity for the step to identify the error in a
machine-processable fashion. Many steps omit this because they do not
include the concept of errors identified by EQNames.</para>

<para>The <tag class="attribute">cause</tag> is an EQName which
identifies an underlying error, if applicable. As an aide to
interoperability, this specification mandates particular error codes
for conditions that can arise in a variety of ways. For example,
<code>err:XD0050</code> is raised for all errors in XPath expressions
in value templates. The implementation may use
<tag class="attribute">cause</tag> to record an underlying error (for
example, the XPath error code).
<impl>The error codes that appear in <tag class="attribute">cause</tag>
are
<glossterm>implementation-dependent</glossterm>.</impl></para>

<para>If the error was caused by a specific document, or by the
location of some erroneous construction in a specific document, the
<tag class="attribute">href</tag>, <tag class="attribute" >line</tag>,
<tag class="attribute">column</tag>, and <tag class="attribute"
>offset</tag> attributes identify this location. Generally, the error
location is identified either with line and column numbers or with an
offset from the beginning of the document, but not usually
both.</para>

<para>The content of the <tag>c:error</tag> element is any well-formed
XML. Specific steps, or specific implementations, may provide more
detail about the format of the content of an error
message.</para>

  <para>In addition to the six step types

        The full vocabulary of standards steps is described in <biblioref linkend="steps30"/>.</para>

    related steps.</para>
    <para>Whether all steps in the XProc namespace are referred to as “standard (atomic) steps” or only the steps

    namespace that are not included in the standard step library may also be referred to as “optional standard 
    steps” if further distinction is required.</para>
  <para>All of the standard (including optional), atomic steps are invoked in the same way:</para>

    <section xml:id="dynamic-errors">
      <title>Dynamic Errors</title>

      <para><termdef xml:id="dt-dynamic-error">A <firstterm>dynamic
      error</firstterm> is one which occurs while a pipeline is being
      evaluated (and cannot be detected before evaluation begins).</termdef>
      Examples of dynamic errors include
      references to URIs that cannot be resolved, steps which fail,
      and pipelines that exhaust the capacity of an implementation
      (such as memory or disk space).</para>

<para>Implementations are required to evaluate the pipeline graph
according to the rules of this specification, but they may choose to
optimize pipeline execution in different ways. This may cause steps to
be evaluated in different orders which consequently has an impact on
error detection.
<impl>The detection of dynamic errors is somewhat
<glossterm>implementation-dependent</glossterm> because the order of
step execution may vary.</impl> In cases where an implementation
is able to run a pipeline without evaluating a particular expression,
or running a particular step, the implementation is never
required evaluate the expression or run the step solely in order to determine
whether doing so causes a dynamic error. For example, if a variable is
declared but never referenced, an implementation may choose whether or
not to evaluate the expression which initializes the variable, which means that if
evaluating the variable’s initializer causes a dynamic error, some
implementations will signal this error and others will not.</para>

<para>There are some cases where this specification requires that
steps must not be executed: for example, the content of a <tag>p:when</tag>
<rfc2119>must not</rfc2119> be executed if the <tag class="attribute">test</tag>
condition is false. This
means that an implementation <rfc2119>must not</rfc2119> signal any dynamic errors that
would arise if the contents of the <tag>p:when</tag> were executed.</para>

<para>An implementation may signal a dynamic error before any source
document is available, but only if it can determine that the error
would be signaled for every possible source document and every
possible set of parameter values.</para>

      <para>If a step fails due to a dynamic error, failure propagates
      upwards until either a <tag>p:try</tag> is encountered or the
      entire pipeline fails. In other words, outside of a
      <tag>p:try</tag>, step failure causes the entire pipeline to
      fail.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The <code>p:document-properties-document()</code> function was removed</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The semantics of <tag>p:if</tag> have been changed. If the test expression is false, <tag>p:if</tag>
          behaves roughly like an identity step. Previously it produced no outputs.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is no longer a static error (XS0093), if <tag>p:option</tag> or <tag>p:variable</tag> have an attribute
            <literal>visibility</literal> and are not children of a <tag>p:library</tag>.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The semantics of <tag>p:choose</tag> have been changed. The default sub-pipeline for a missing
            <tag>p:otherwise</tag> is a <tag>p:identity</tag> step (with the additional feature that it isn’t an error
          if there’s no default readable port). A primary output port on the <tag>p:when</tag> branches for this is
          required.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The way the context item for XPath expressions is provided has been changed. It is now provided if and only 
        if the connection delivers exactly one document, otherwise the context item is undefined. A new error (XD0001) is
        introduced. It is raised if an XPath expression makes use of the context item, but the context item is undefined.
        Two dynamic errors (XD0005 and XD0008) were removed.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Content type shortcuts and the notion of forbidden content types have been added.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The semantics pf <tag>p:viewport</tag> have been changed. HTML documents are now allowed as input and
        <option>match</option> may now match every node type except attributes and namespace nodes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Static <tag>p:variable</tag>s have been removed; the
